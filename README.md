## Basic features:
*	**Health Bars**: The health bar decreases each time the player fails to reflect a ball. The game is over when the health bar reaches zero.
*	**POW bars**: Each POW bar allows the use of Power Ups including Bubble Shields, Rainbow Shots, Momentum Exchange, and Reflect. Each use of a Power Up will consume a certain amount of POWs.
*	**Slippery Paddles**: Paddles do not immediately stop but decelerate when the player releases the Up/Down buttons. This adds difficulty by challenging players to plan their moves ahead.
*	**The ball**: The ball will shoot from the centre in random colors, speeds, sizes, and angles.
*	**Sound**: Sound effects and music are added to increase immersion (Enjoy it!).

## Advanced features:
*	**Bubble Shield**: Players can consume POWs to generate a bubble shield, which can deflect balls back.
*	**Rainbow Shot**: Players can consume POWs to activate the paddles with rainbow mode. In an activated rainbow mode, all reflected balls become rainbow balls and move twice as fast.
*	**Reflection**:  Balls will bounce back from each other.
*	**Exchange of Momentum**: If a rainbow ball hits a normal ball, they will exchange momentum. That is, normal balls become rainbow balls, and vice versa. 
*	**Particles**: A particle system is built in this game. If a ball hits the left or right boundary, it will explode into a particle cluster, like fireworks.
